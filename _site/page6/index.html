		<div class="date">January 31, 2015</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-8">
		<p>For the first time in my life, I feel like an engineer.</p>

<p>I have launched a startup and built countless production websites. I teach programming classes at a startup trade school. And I never felt like an engineer until now. </p>

<p>I have no university degree declaring that I have formal training in computer science or software engineering. My degree says I know accounting. I started teaching myself how to code because I hated the idea of going to a big corporation or a small financial advisory firm and I developed a dream of having a business I could build myself. It was 2010 and THE SOCIAL NETWORK had just dropped, amplifying the dream of thousands of young entrepreneurs who were convinced that if they just learned how to code they could become the next Zuckerberg. I am amused now to say that I was one of them. </p>

<p>2010 came and went. 2011 came along and I left school and became a management consultant rather than a startup entrepreneur. Nothing wrong with making some decent coin right after college, right? I enjoyed doing that for a while until the itch started to get after me again. I volunteered to help a friend get his startup off the ground and finally launched a project. I still didn’t feel like an engineer. </p>

<p>I took a full-time engineering role at a public relations firm and was paid to code for the first time in my life. I was completely lost. When you’re learning how to code you stay in a happy little place playing connect the dots with tutorials and occasionally venturing out on your own experiment. When you’re building a brand new startup you’re working with zero code base at all and can make it in your own image. When you take a full-time gig with an established company, you’re suddenly thrown into the code wilderness where things aren’t perfect and you’re forced to confront systems without time for full-blown tutorials on them. And it’s scary as hell. I didn’t feel like an engineer. </p>

<p>No matter what I tried, I couldn’t make myself feel like a professional coder. I thought first “if I launch a startup” then I’ll absolutely feel like an engineer. That didn’t work. I launched a product and still felt like an impostor. Then I said “if I get paid to be an engineer” then I’ll feel like an engineer. I started getting a paycheck for coding and just felt lost and confused. I kept looking for someone else or some milestone to make me feel like an engineer. I started speaking on panels and blogging and churning out pet projects, anything I could to hopefully hit that point where I’d feel like I’d made it.</p>

<p>Sometime in the mix of side projects and full-time work, I had so much going on that I forgot to think about being an engineer. I was just doing the work, day in and day out. And when I finally remembered to think about it again, I realized that something had shifted. Doing the work - actual engineering work, not tech meetups or networking or speaking on panels - had turned me into an engineer. I wasn’t talking about being an engineer or thinking about being an engineer, I was just <em>doing</em> it. </p>

<p>Ira Glass of This American Life has a very poignant reflection on storytelling that should resonate with would-be engineers as well. I leave it here to close this post with his words. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.</p>

		<p>I could write code for days using the <code>math</code> module and never hit the end. <code>math</code> is huge. It’s designed to keep you from rewriting a stack of mathematical functions that someone had inevitably written before (formulas for calculating the sine, cosine, tangent, etc). </p>

<p>So rather than write a stack of example code, let’s instead discuss what <code>math</code> can do for you. <code>math</code> can do any of these functions on integers only - <code>cmath</code> provides the same, but allows complex numbers.</p>

<h3 id="number-theoretic-and-representation-functions">Number-theoretic and representation functions</h3>

<p>These functions deal with a few basic theoretical calculations that didn’t quite fit anywhere else. Things like <code>factorial()</code>, <code>fabs()</code> (which calculates absolute value), and <code>modf()</code> which returns the fractional and integer parts of a float can all be found here. </p>

<h3 id="power-and-logarithmic-functions">Power and logarithmic functions</h3>

<p>As can be expected, you’ll find things with exponents and logarithms here. Need to calculate e^x? Use <code>exp(x)</code>. Need to get x^y? Use <code>pow(x, y)</code>. Logarithms use <code>log(x, [base])</code>. Easy stuff here.</p>

<h3 id="trigonometric-functions">Trigonometric functions</h3>

<p>This is where all of the trigonometric functions live: things like <code>sin(x)</code>, <code>cos(x)</code>, <code>tan(x)</code>. I wish I’d known about this in the eleventh grade with Mrs. May. </p>

<h3 id="angular-conversion-functions">Angular conversion functions</h3>

<p>Need to go from degrees to radians? Use <code>radians(x)</code>. Need to go from radians to degrees? Use <code>degrees(x)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="hyperbolic-functions">Hyperbolic functions</h3>

<p>I never used these in eleventh grade and am only moderately aware of what they do. If you need the hyperbolic tangent of x - <code>tanh(x)</code> - or the inverse hyperbolic cosine - <code>acosh(x)</code> - this is where to look. </p>

<h3 id="error-functions">Error functions</h3>

<p>Same thing for error functions. I am not proud of how much math I don’t know right now.</p>

<h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>

<p>These I’ve got, though! This is where <code>pi</code> and <code>e</code> live.</p>

<p><code>math</code> is great, and if you’re going to using Python for statistical or scientific computing, it’s a must-know. </p>

		<p>In my <a href="/2015/01/21/string-presentation-with-textwrap.html">last post</a>, I discovered that there are all sorts of awesome things you can do to format strings for presentation in a Python program. In this episode, I learn that it’s possible to do the same thing with all Python objects using <code>pprint</code>!</p>

<p>Let’s crack it open and get to some pretty-printing!</p>

<pre><code>import pprint

pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4, width=60)
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, I’ve implemented a <code>PrettyPrinter</code> object that expects to indent things at the four-space mark and each line can only be 60 characters long. Cool. </p>

<pre><code>team = ['We', 'live', 'in', 'cities', 'you\'ll', 'never', 'see', 'on', 'screen', 'not', 'very', 'pretty', 'but', 'we', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'to', 'run', 'things']

# yes, that is a list of words in the chorus of Lorde's "Team"

pp.pprint(team)
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, awesome. I now print everything on its own line with a slight indentation. </p>

<p>What happens if I throw a custom object at it?</p>

<pre><code>class Dog:
	def __init__(self, name, owner):
		self.name = name
		self.owner = owner

my_dog = Dog('Rufus', 'Joe')

pp.pprint(my_dog) # &lt;__main__.Dog instance at 0x1007ebc20&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, that’s disappointing. I was	hoping I’d get a nifty way of doing this without having to define a custom <code>repr()</code> method on <code>Dog</code>. Ah well.</p>

<p>So <code>pprint</code> does some stuff awesome, and some stuff… not as awesome. Onward!</p>

		<p>I haven’t written that many programs that run solely from the command line with a lot of user instructions incorporated into the program flow, so I haven’t done much Python display text processing. But if I had, <code>textwrap</code> would very likely be one of my best friends.</p>

<p>The <code>textwrap</code> module is designed to wrap text, produce some formatted paragraphs, or totally strip out indentation from strings. It’s there for your convenience. Let’s take a look at what it can do:</p>

<pre><code>import textwrap

my_string = "The textwrap module is designed to wrap text, produce some formatted paragraphs, or totally strip out indentation from strings. It's there for your convenience. Let's take a look at what it can do:"

print my_string

print textwrap.wrap(my_string, 60)
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa whoa whoa there, that’s some weirdness. I’ve clearly got a cut-up string there, but it’s in list format. Let’s clean that up a bit:</p>

<pre><code>print "\n".join(textwrap.wrap(my_string, 60))
</code></pre>

<p>But wait a second, that seems like writing a bunch of characters that I didn’t want to write. Let’s use <code>fill()</code>!</p>

<pre><code>print textwrap.fill(my_string)
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so <code>fill()</code> pretty much does the exact same thing as <code>wrap()</code>, but it automatically joins everything and adds some newlines in. </p>

<p>Now let’s fiddle around with <code>dedent()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>my_string = "\t\t" + my_string

print my_string

print textwrap.dedent(my_string)
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve added in some tabs here just to showcase what <code>dedent()</code> is designed to do. You can add whitespace to the beginning of your strings - such as if you wanted to include paragraphs in the source code - but then strip it out for presentation in your app.</p>

<p>And that’s a <code>textwrap</code>!</p>

	<div class="col-8">
		<p>The <code>StringIO</code> library has a nifty purpose. It provides you with a buffer in memory that allows you to read and write strings without saving a file to disk. </p>

<pre><code>import StringIO

output = StringIO.StringIO()

output.write('This is a string!\n')
output.write('This is a second line string!')
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so we’ve got ourselves a string buffer with some strings. Now what can we do?</p>

<pre><code>print output.read()
</code></pre>

<p>Wait… that didn’t really do anything. Ah yes! Because it’s a file-like object, we have to return to the beginning of the object to read it again.</p>

<pre><code>output.seek(0)
print output.read()
</code></pre>

<p>Anything you can do with a file, you can do with this string buffer. It’s quite useful for capturing output or dealing with test cases like these. And in the event that you need a much faster cousin, <code>StringIO</code> comes with a <code>cStringIO</code> <a href="/2015/01/12/storing-objects-with-the-best-named-module-ever-pickle.html">just like our</a> <code>pickle</code> module came with its <code>cPickle</code>.

		<p>In our <a href="/2015/01/17/the-images-are-coming-from-inside-the-bytestreams.html">last installment</a>, we cracked open some image files and looked at the raw bytestreams to assess what type of image file we were looking at. Python’s <code>imghdr</code> module is designed to automate all of that at need. Python provides a companion library, <code>sndhdr</code>, to do the exact same thing for sound files. </p>

<p>Did you know, for example, that all .aif files start with “FO RM,” followed by characters indicating the file size, followed by “AIFF?” I didn’t know that. MP3 files start with characters to synchronize the frames, followed by the MPEG version. Python is here to automatically check all of this for you.</p>

	<div class="col-8">
		<p>Okay, let’s first clarify that I’ve been working with digital images for longer than I’m comfortable with to just now learn how to do this. But that’s neither here nor there. Obviously, images are streams of bytes just like every other piece of information stored on your computer. And obviously, there’s got to be something inherent in the byte stream and how it’s encoded that tells the computer how to open it. There’s something that makes a PNG different from a TIFF, and the computer knows how the difference between the two. But how? How does a computer know when it’s looking at a PNG or a TIFF when it starts to read the file? </p>

<p>The answer, my friends, is in the byte stream. I just learned how to read it with mine own two eyes and I am very excited to share this knowledge with you. </p>

<p>Open up a PNG file with your code-writing text editor of choice (I know this will work in Sublime). You’ll have a massive eight-column byte stream open up in front of you, and you’ll also notice that it starts with these characters: <code>8950 4e47 0d0a</code>. Those are hex codes, and they mean something very specific: <code>‰P NG \r\n</code>. This is the universal sign of a PNG file, and you’ll find it on any PNG file that you open! </p>

<p>Now do the same with a TIFF file. You’ll notice the file starts with the following hex codes: <code>4d4d 002a 0000</code>. That stands for <code>MM NUL* NULNULNULNUL</code>. The MM, in this instance, signals the computer that we’re working in a big-endian data format. We then have a null character and an asterisk - which also corresponds to the number 42. The 42 here is chosen for its “<a href="http://www.douglasadams.eu/en_h2g2_references.php">deep philosophical significance</a>.” If you see the byte order and 42, you’ve got a TIFF file!</p>

<p>Chances are that you won’t want to visually inspect your image files to see what they are all the time, so Python has provided a helper library to do that: <code>imghdr</code>. It has one function:</p>

<pre><code>import imghdr

print imghdr.what('snowman.tiff') # 'tiff'
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>what(filename)</code> function is used to detect file format. It can do so for the following image types: RGB, GIF, PBM, PPM, TIFF, RAST, XBM, JPEG, BMP, PNG. </p>

<p>Go forth and read bytestreams!</p>

	</div>
	<div class="col-8">
		<p>In the 1970s, DES was all the rage. The Data Encryption Standard was the standard for encryption of federal government data and everything unclassified was expected to use it. The algorithm uses a 56-bit key size and some NSA-suggested substitution boxes to encrypt and decrypt data. It was great for the 1970s, but we knew it was susceptible to brute-force attacks then - and in the 1990s, DES was finally cracked. It’s since been replaced by more robust cryptographic algorithms, but it remains a part of the legacy Unix codebase via the <code>crypt(3)</code> tool. </p>

<p>Because you might need to one day access legacy systems where data is encrypted using <code>crypt(3)</code>, Python has provided a helpful little module with <code>crypt</code>. It has a single function: <code>crypt.crypt(word, salt)</code>, where the word represents the data to be encrypted and the salt is a two-character alphanumeric string. It’s as easy as would be expected:</p>

<pre><code>import crypt

print crypt.crypt('hello there', 'ht') # ht5gSI1o04H8I
</code></pre>

<p>And with just that simple function, we have an DES-encrypted password for use on a legacy Unix system. In case you ever need one.</p>

		<div class="date">January 14, 2015</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-8">
		<p>I certainly didn’t. YIQ is used if you’re building software that’s going to transmit over NTSC (broadcast television). YIQ contains information about the luminance and chrominance of colors. Luminance, as we might expect, can be measured on a spectrum from totally white to totally black. <a href="http://wolfcrow.com/blog/understanding-luminance-and-chrominance/">Chrominance is the color information in a signal</a>. These two values merge together in the YIQ data format, where Y represents luminance information, and I and Q represent chrominance information.</p>

<p>In the event that you are ever building software that must make use of the YIQ color format but you’re really only great at dealing with RGB, Python is happy to accommodate you! The <code>colorsys</code> module provides color format conversions between RGB, YIQ, HLS and HSV. It works about how you’d expect:</p>

<pre><code>import colorsys

print colorsys.rgb_to_yiq(82, 0, 99)

print colorsys.yiq_to_rgb(35.49, 17.52, 47.91)

print colorsys.rgb_to_hls(82, 0, 99)

print colorsys.hls_to_rgb(0.833, 49.5, -1.020619)

print colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(82, 0, 99)

print colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(0.833333333, 1, 99)
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s it - just those six functions for all of the color conversions you’ll ever need when dealing with coordinate-based color systems.</p>

	<div class="col-8">
		<p>Now that we’ve talked about both <a href="http://josephmosby.com/2015/01/12/storing-objects-with-the-best-named-module-ever-pickle.html">pickle</a> and <a href="http://josephmosby.com/2014/12/22/dbm-non-relational-databases-before-that-was-a-thing.html">anydbm</a>, we can now talk about marrying the two with <code>shelve</code>. The <code>shelve</code> module brings <code>pickle</code> functionality to dbm-style databases, allowing us to store massive data entries in dictionary form without the expected performance hit. It’s the middle option between a full-on database implementation and simple flat file storage. </p>

<p>We create a new shelf like so:</p>

<pre><code>import shelve

s = shelve.open('shelving', flag='c') # the open() method is a wrapper around anydbm.open()

s['name'] = "Joe"

s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>A shelf is created by using the <code>shelve</code> module’s <code>open()</code> method, a wrapper around <code>anydbm.open()</code>. Once we have that shelf, we can treat it much like we would a dictionary. We save a value by specifying a dictionary key/value pair. Finally, we close the filestream. </p>

<p>Reading data from the shelf is equally simple:</p>

<pre><code>import shelve

s = shelve.open('shelving', flag='r')

print s['name']

s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>By default, a shelf does not save modifications to volatile object structure. We see this in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>import shelve

s = shelve.open('shelving', flag='c') # the open() method is a wrapper around anydbm.open()

s['name'] = {}

s.close()

s = shelve.open('shelving')

s['name']['fname'] = 'Joe'
s['name']['lname'] = 'Mosby'

s.close()

s = shelve.open('shelving')

print s['name'] # will print {}

s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>However, if we enable <code>writeback</code> when we open the shelf, we can make direct changes to an object. (warning: performance will take a hit as this will open a potentially massive object in memory)</p>

<pre><code>import shelve

s = shelve.open('shelving', flag='c') # the open() method is a wrapper around anydbm.open()

s['name'] = {}

s.close()

s = shelve.open('shelving', writeback=True)

s['name']['fname'] = 'Joe'
s['name']['lname'] = 'Mosby'

s.close()

s = shelve.open('shelving')

print s['name'] # will print {'fname': 'Joe', 'lname': 'Mosby'}

s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s where we stand with <code>shelve</code>. Not too much to it - just a little persistence library built for a very niche database format.</p>
