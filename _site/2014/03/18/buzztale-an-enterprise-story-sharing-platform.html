		<h3>Buzztale&#58; An Enterprise Story-Sharing Platform</h3>

	</div>
	<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
		<p>Innovative corporate communications are difficult things to pull off well. If the company’s large enough, it probably comes saddled with a restrictive Microsoft suite of applications, including SharePoint, Outlook, and perhaps Yammer. Communicating to your employees is often done in the form of an email template with mostly text and a few pictures that’s brittle enough to restrict modification based on the type of event. Yammer freed things up enough to have a conversation, but you’re still locked into the Yammer style that looks like an ugly version of Twitter. Not fun at all.</p>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.buzztale.com">Buzztale</a> over the past few days as an alternative to the typical approach. Buzztale brands themselves as a tool for creating “Enterprise Story Networks” - think a collaborative version of Storify. Though the platform has a really slick desktop interface, it’s definitely geared toward mobile. Users can only create stories and add new items through the Buzztale mobile apps.</p>

<p>Buzztale has thought through their audience well. Each story comes pre-built with an embeddable widget like this one below:</p>

<div id="latte-24d471" style="width:510px;height:600px;margin:0 auto;">

</div>

</script>

<ol>
  <li>In the first frame, I easily joined Kate Jackson’s story to view her content and could have added my own.</li>
  <li>In the second, I took a screenshot of their well-designed mobile interface.</li>
  <li>I’ve added a nice picture here with a caption from my phone.</li>
  <li>In case you don’t want to post any visuals, you can just add straight up notes. There’s no character limit here, so you can type epistles if you like.</li>
  <li>You can also search for tweets, and add them to your stream. Buzztale actually requires that you search for a particular hashtag, assuming that you’d be creating this story to align with a topic or event.</li>
  <li>And, finally, another picture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Buzztale looks and feels fantastic, and I’d use it as event coverage without a second’s thought. However, it’s got a few things to add before I’d consider rolling it out as a major corporate communications platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stories are public, and there’s no way to change that. If I have a story of a private event, it’s going to be out there for the world.</li>
  <li>I need more Twitter functionality - specifically, I’d like to add tweets from a particular account or @-replies to a user.</li>
  <li>I’d like to be able to add certain content from the desktop. The mobile version is perfect, but I also want to be able to upload pictures and type notes as well.</li>
  <li>Recap and “about this page” text boxes to introduce the story would be excellent.</li>
  <li>Customizable URLs. The story from the widget above can be found at <a href="http://www.buzztale.com/b969e0/24d471">http://www.buzztale.com/b969e0/24d471</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This team has a lot of potential, though, and I’m sure many of my requests are in their pipeline. They just signed their first big pilot customer in <a href="http://www.tele2.com">Tele2</a>, a European telecommunications provider, and have the backing of Europe’s <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a> and <a href="http://www.startupsauna.com">Startup Sauna</a>. I’m excited to see where they go, and will look forward to my first event to put them to a live test.</p>
