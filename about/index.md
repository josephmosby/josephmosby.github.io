I lead advanced analytics teams for Deloitte's strategic intelligence and investigations practice in Washington, DC.

My teams consistent of software engineers, data scientists, and intelligence analysts. We build interesting things that answer questions and open doors for our clients. 

In the past, I've been a practicing data engineer and data scientist in the Python, Scala, and Spark/Hadoop world; I've built news applications that served thousands of concurrent viewers; I've taught courses in applied artificial intelligence, Python engineer, and financial analysis.

In this blog, I explore organizational culture, deeply technical topics, psychology, and productivity. I have also done recaps of self-experimentation.
