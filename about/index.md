I am a software engineer who loves people. Seriously, you all are the best. 

Currently, I'm exploring high performance computing using Python, Scala, and Apache Spark. In the past, I've built news applications that served thousands of concurrent viewers as well as smaller data analysis platforms that attacked niche problems in the media world. I've also taught courses in both Python and financial analysis.

In this blog, I explore deeply technical topics, psychology and productivity, and a few things about culture. I also try to do monthly recaps of personal experiments.

Interested in more? I'm around the internet:
