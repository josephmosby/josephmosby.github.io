I am a software engineer who loves people. Seriously, you all are the best. 

I solve problems with code at the [National Journal](http://www.nationaljournal.com). I also help people learn how to do the same at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/washington-dc).

This blog contains writing on Python, the DC tech community, web development, and culture. I reserve the right to append additional topics as necessary. 

If you're a journalist, PR flack or teacher who's interested in adding some more technology into their work, I'd love to chat with you. 

Interested in more? I'm around the internet:
