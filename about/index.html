	<h1>about me</h1>
	<div class="blue_cell padded_div">
		<p>I'm a web developer and digital strategist based in Washington, DC. Though I've been heavily involved with the web since I started in technical support during college, I discovered my love of code as an aspiring Python programmer while an accounting student.</p>
		<p>I'm currently building content-rich sites for clients as a developer at APCO Worldwide, a global public relations and communications firm. I've been doing quite a bit of Drupal work in this role, with all of our clients' sites requiring custom design rather than some stock template. I bring a full digital presence to our clients, helping work through architectural issues, digital content strategies and web branding presentation.</p>
		<p>Prior to this, I worked with Routeam to build version 1.0 of their Ruby on Rails application. Routeam is a fitness and healthy living startup powered by a full stack Rails app, complete with user fitness profiles, credit card processing and retail functionality.</p>
		<p>I've also been active in the federal government's IT world since 2011, first working with agencies as a cybersecurity consultant for Deloitte and now an active participant in the open data and social government communities. I've worked with the largest computing infrastructures in the world with some of the greatest possible security and availability concerns, and did it all while considering those effects on their business as a CPA.</p>
