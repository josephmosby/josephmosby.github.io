title: The work side of work-life balance
---

I have worked consecutive seventy-hour work weeks just twice in my life. The first time I did so, I was a consultant at Deloitte in the middle of an internal controls review. I flew back and forth to Minnesota and North Carolina to chat with IT professionals about every little detail of their security setup. I'd do interviews and write up my own paperwork in the day, then review my team's work at night. I had it light compared to most of my Deloitte colleagues around the world, as federal government contractors are largely capped on how many hours they can burn per week. Commercial Deloitters do this for months on end.

The second time has been this August. My team has been in an all-out sprint to complete the rebuild of a legacy PHP app into two screaming fast Python applications. It's the best code I've ever written, warts and all. I've learned an incredible amount about how to build something that's going to operate on the scale of a newsroom, and I'm confident that people are going to love what we've made for them. 

Most of the food I've eaten has been delivery fare catered to the office. Postmates loves us. I get home with enough time to decompress for half an hour before passing out. My workouts are slacking off. I suspect I'm losing weight. But I've never been more excited to deliver a piece of work, and I've never grown so much as an engineer in such a short span of time.

The New York Times' [Amazon piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html) came out in this timeframe. There are some horrible anecdotes in the story. There are also some truths. My Twitter timeline's commentary was split between both sides of the story, with some appalled that Amazon could do such things to its employees and others impressed at what Amazon has produced with such a culture. My heart was comparably split. I am impressed with what Amazon employees have pulled off, but I am also extremely aware that I have the perspective of a single, childless individual. 

It wasn't until I read Mark Suster's [take on Amazon](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2015/08/17/what-to-make-of-amazons-work-practices/) that I equated their culture back to my own experiences. I have always been drawn to places that will push me that hard - not because I crave abuse, but because I want to grow in a way that I believe only comes from diving headfirst into a subject. It's not the time commitment I want. It's the challenge. Maybe I will choose differently in ten years. That's the wonderful thing about American working culture: if you don't like it, you can just go some place else. And if you've got those experiences on your resume, you write your ticket.

I am not suffering because I've worked longer hours these past few weeks. I chose this because it's pushing me, and I invite others to make different choices. Hopefully, there's room for all of us.
