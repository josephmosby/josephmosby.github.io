When the next tech bubble pops, it's going to come for the DC tech scene's head. Silicon Valley will be okay and New York is New York forever, but the bubble's going to be rough in DC. 

Engineers in DC are quite different than engineers almost everywhere else. We are polished. We can be conversational and many of us suck it up and put a tie on to go to work, even if we don't like doing it. If you want to work on ray guns and flying cars, chances are that the government's doing that sort of work and they expect engineers to adhere to certain standards that do not apply to engineers anywhere else. We are used to this.

About two years ago, after Barack Obama won a presidential campaign with a marketing team that sang the praises of agile development, many of the power brokers in DC suddenly became aware that agile was a "thing." Eric Ries' The Lean Startup was a topic of conversation in DC, much as it had been in Silicon Valley circles in 2010 and 2011. Program managers were suddenly told they had to be "agile", and "iterate," and they skipped over the entire part about asking customers if they really needed a product and started straight into asking developers to build features with unclear goals or requirements or users. Agile could only halfway work in the environment of government budgeting.

As this was going on, the DC startup scene was growing. Bolstered by the rise of 1776 and Accelerprise in the incubator world as well as the DC Tech Meetup and a stack of smaller meetup groups, the engineers quietly coding in government agencies suddenly found others who shared their longing for a startup community to rival Silicon Valley and New York. The meetups came faster than the startups, and then the educational events started. Anyone could learn how to code, launch their own startup and leave government bureaucracy altogether. Engineers suddenly saw a light at the end of the tunnel at the prospect of bringing more former lawyers into the fold. Tech is now hot in DC.

I fear that the DC technology community's soul has been poisoned. 

We are aspiring to nothing of consequence. 

We are leaving our desks at 5:30, attending two or three meetups a week and then heading home. We are not sweating over our creations because our creations are not important enough to us to sweat over. We have marketing toys and dashboards and "portals." We are not trying to change the world, we're either trying to make a quick buck or figure out how to make the bureaucracy go away. 

And when the tech bubble pops and startups lose their luster, we'll take the hardest hit because we don't have our creations to hold on to. We just have a "scene."
