First things first: let's give some credit where credit is due. I was inspired to write this post by Karan Goel's [note on 2014](https://medium.com/@karan/the-year-it-was-a-comprehensive-personal-year-in-review-2014-14c1fcfcec4b). You can follow him [here](https://twitter.com/karangoel).

I have the benefit of celebrating a birthday five days before the year rolls over, so I tend to doubly reflect on a calendar year as well as a new year of maturity. In 2014, I was 26 years old, no longer in my early twenties and now a few years removed from college. While I typically beat my chest for my triumphs over the year, this year had a very different tone to it. I neither set nor achieved any goals this year, and it made for an incredible experience. 

### The Highlights of 2014

* I grew closer to the people I care about. At the risk of sounding overly sappy, I have some amazing people in my life that have been awesome through thick and thin. Growing closer to them has easily been the best part of 2014.

* I went to Las Vegas for the first time with a good crew of former co-workers. I left one job in 2013 and am fortunate enough to still count many of my teammates as friends. Experiencing the absurdity of Vegas with them was a great way to ring in the New Year.

* I developed relationships with a few great mentors. There are many people who have helped me over the years, but a few particular souls were extremely valuable this year. They had life advice, career advice and engineering advice for me - all of which I needed.

* I traveled to Europe and got outside the major cities. I had never been to the remote parts of Europe (Lake Como is stunningly beautiful), nor had I been to Eastern Europe (they thought I was Hungarian in Budapest). Combining those two locales with Venice and Milan made for an incredible journey. 

* I discovered that I actually like selling. I volunteered for a sales pitch competition at my company to try my hand at business development. Though my pitch didn't win, it resulted in some invites for future new business pitches that I've really enjoyed. I'm hoping for more of this in 2015. 

* I started teaching Python courses at General Assembly and have more in store for 2015. Python's a phenomenal language and I couldn't be happier to share it with more people.

### What's Next? 

2014 was a year of taking a step back and finally not sweating anything and everything so much. I spent so much (okay, all) of my early twenties being the embodiment of Yoda's quote from _The Empire Strikes Back_: "All his life has he looked away, to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was, what he was doing." I spent a lot of time working to get somewhere else without enjoying where I was and I missed out on quite a bit of living. Age 26 was about stopping those tendencies. Therefore 26 came with no goals, no frantic purpose that I needed to achieve. I stopped to observe and enjoy where I was in life.

And now that I've learned how to do that, it's time to begin pushing myself again.

* I want to write a small program and explanatory post for each module in the Python Standard Library. I discovered I had a lot to improve upon in my command of the Python language through a few challenges this year. This goal is designed to teach me the ins and outs of every facet of what Python has to offer beyond its uses in web development.

* I'm finally going to learn Spanish. I struggled through French classes in high school and college but never developed conversational mastery of a foreign language. That changes this year.

* I'm going to broaden my social circle. I love the DC technology community, but it is extremely insular. I can generally count on seeing at least one of my friends at any tech event I attend. That's not good for my friendships (since I can't really forge a deep connection with someone at a networking event) nor my career (because it's all the same faces). I'm going to focus on a few key events in the DC tech world but plan to see what else is out there in the community.
