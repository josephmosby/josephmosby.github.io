title: Why your company&#39;s &#39;Thought Leadership&#39; probably sucks
---

I hate the term "thought leadership." I hate the title of "thought leader" being used to describe a person. I am a thought leader in my distaste for the term, as I was raised in a [consulting firm](http://josephmosby.com/2015/03/25/what-consulting-will-not-teach-you.html) and a PR firm immediately following that. Both types of businesses have a tendency to extol the virtues of "thought leadership," with one even making a living off convincing others that "thought leadership" is a Good Thing. 

The only thing that might be worse than thought leadership would be thought leadership about JavaScript, which deserves no such thing. But I digress.

Thought leadership is rooted in the idea that people will give you or your company more money if you establish yourself as a Thought Leader, which is a consulting euphemism for "Smart Person." A Thought Leader gives talks at conferences, writes blog posts on the corporate blog, pens articles for industry trade publications, and speaks on panels. I believe the idea here is that people will hear your ideas at a conference or read them on the corporate blog and suddenly decide that they should give you a stack of business. 

(I have never heard of this actually being the case, and people willing to give away their hard earned money because of a blog post were likely not going to have it for very long anyway)

Zipcar founder [Robin Chase](http://www.robinchase.org/#every-day-create-the-world-you-want-to-live-in) is often cited as a Thought Leader in the corporate world. But Robin Chase is no longer active in the corporate world, she's writing books and doing speaking tours. [Marc Andreessen](https://twitter.com/pmarca) receives similar distinction, but he's also not a corporate person - he co-owns a VC firm. Tony Hsieh is considered a Thought Leader, and he's spent the past decade or so letting go of the reins.

I read about Tony Hsieh's ideas because they are entertaining to me and because they make me think. Not because I'm trying to buy shoes from him or model my business after him - just because I find them interesting. His ideas are _his_ voice. They aren't Zappos' voice. 

# thought leadership needs an interesting person, not a corporate commitment
