From an early age, human beings [thrive on order](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/merrill-palmer_quarterly/v054/54.4.johnson.html_). We learn more quickly in orderly environments and tend to be stressed by disorderly ones. 

Technological systems are inherently disorganized systems. Though many of the individual pieces of a personal computer or operating system were designed with precision, very few computing systems were designed with a single specific end user in mind. They were designed to be useful to as many potential users as possible without compromising the original purpose - and so I can install [the same operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_adopters) as the government of Largo, Florida and the Russian Federation. Combine that with the [bazaar model of software development](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257), and we find that the average software engineer is dealing with systems that have been building complexity longer than the engineer has been alive.

The universe itself tends toward complexity!
