I am out of control. 

In 2015, and in most of the years before that, I convinced myself that I was in control. I worked out regularly. I studied various computer science topics for hours before bed. 

the year of systems
	- not in control
	- perceptions of being in control
		- computer science research
		- working out
		- sleeping the right amount
		- sleeping too little

	- the realization: the world is massively more complex than I gave it credit for
		- unexpected forces
	- the perception of control began to break down as the world increased in complexity
		- unable to keep up
		- unexpected breakdowns
	- there is an inability to plan for most if not all 
	- importance of mental state, alignment of external forces to long term goals
	
	- decoupling of action and intended consequence

	- the problem: if I confront a goal that must be realized on a timeframe longer than one in which I can conceivably control external variables, how should I approach the task?

	- the development of systems

	- DO RESEARCH ON WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT, PSYCHOLOGICALLY
