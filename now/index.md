**I'm currently working on the following projects:**

* Refactoring the codebase of [nationaljournal.com](http://www.nationaljournal.com/) to use [Django's class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/class-based-views/), along with a significant simplification of our JavaScript code (update: Almost done with this one, just putting on some polishing touches on functionality before I fully turn it over to be styled)
* Reading the following books:
	- [The E-Myth Revisited](http://amzn.to/1RpDBZe) (update: slogging through this one)
