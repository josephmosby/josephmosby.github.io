**I'm currently working on the following projects:**

* Beginning a new position at Deloitte
* Settling into a new home
* Filling my room's walls with handwritten posters of ideas
* Focusing on clarity of thought and expression
* Adding more weight to my four big lifts: bench press, back squats, deadlifts and shoulder presses
* Writing 
* Reading great books (on my desk now: Marc Levinson's [The Box](http://amzn.to/1rynCy6) and Seneca's [Letters from a Stoic](http://amzn.to/1rynCy6))
