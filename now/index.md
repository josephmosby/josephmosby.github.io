**I'm currently working on the following projects:**

* Learning Scala
* Summer travels
* Steel club and steel mace training
* Refreshing my CPA knowledge
* Reading great books (on my desk now: Andy Grove's _High Output Management_ and Philip Chavanne's _The Early Tales of Snow and Oakham_)

This page was inspired by Derek Sivers' [Now](http://sivers.org/now). Last updated from my desk in Washington, DC.
