*** What is Github?

[Github](http://www.github.com) is a version control platform based on Git. Users create "repositories" of code, which track changes as users commit code to the repository. At any point, a user can revert to a prior change, or branch the code off to work independently on an individual feature. Repositories may be public or private, based on the owner's preference. A private repository can only been seen by those users that the owner selects.
