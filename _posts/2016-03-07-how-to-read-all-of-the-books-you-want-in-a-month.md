title: How to Read All of the Books You Want in a Month
---

In the past two months, I've drastically scaled up the number of books I read on a per month basis. On average, I take out two books a week, a far cry from [a book every single day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bB_fVDlvhc). Sometimes, it's enjoyable and relaxing reading, sometimes it's tiring work. The end result, though, is always worthwhile. 

I've employed a few different strategies in these two months to churn through my booklist. I don't have a particular order or anything, so I'm just going to list them out here:

* *Read fiction in audiobook format.* My colleagues at National Journal got me started on the audiobook kick. A lot of them walk or bike to work, popping in their headphones for the commute and cranking away at one novel after another. Best part: a lot of the audiobooks are available on [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) (i.e., for free!), but anything else can likely be found on [Audible](http://www.audible.com/).
* *Maintain a Goodreads list along with a queue of books at my house.* What I want to read oscillates from week to week. I can't say at the beginning of month what I'm going to want to read the next week. So, I don't try. I throw every book I want to read into [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/) to save it for later. And I try my hardest, through a combination of Amazon and the DC Public Library, to make sure there are four unread books at my house at all times: two nonfiction and two fiction. If you don't have a library card yet, perhaps [BooksForDC](http://booksfordc.org/) will finally persuade you by showing when a book you want on Amazon could be had for free by reserving it at the library. 
* *Stop reading and watching other stuff that I don't really care about.* I don't watch much television, online or otherwise, half because I don't own a television and half because there's nothing much I care to watch. I don't think I have the attention span for long-running shows, with _Game of Thrones_ and _House of Cards_ being the only exception. I even dropped _Breaking Bad_ after three seasons. I just couldn't keep up. By avoiding most video content and doing my best to stay away from the dopamine hits of regular social media usage, I free up more time to focus on my reading.
* *Read only two books at a time, one nonfiction during the day and one fiction before bed.* I don't stick to this rhythm wholesale any more, as it doesn't mesh well with my audiobooks. However, it seems that this rhythm may have made it easier to focus on tasks *other* that reading, such as social media abstinence or regular experimental code writing.
* *Move the needle a little bit every day.* I have a line item in my [Way of Life](http://wayoflifeapp.com/) app that just says "Read." Nothing more than that, just a gentle reminder to get a few pages done every day.

There's probably a lot more I could try to get even more reading done, so if anything is working for you I want to hear about it! [@josephmosby](https://twitter.com/josephmosby)
