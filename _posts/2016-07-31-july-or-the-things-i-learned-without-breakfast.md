title: July, or the things I learned without breakfast
---

What would you do with your week if you knew you wouldn't feel guilty about what you *didn't* do?

There's an implied answer to this question that's sort of guilt-inducing in itself. The implied answer of "oh, you *didn't* go skydiving off the Amalfi Coast? You *didn't* launch a startup? You *didn't* see every one of your friends and family members? Suppose you did all that. What would you do the next day? And the next? How would you structure your life?

I have this voice that nags at the back of my head and it tells me weird things on a regular basis. It's really obsessed with eating breakfast in the morning. I'm pretty sure that this is because I used to force myself to eat these massive breakfasts and second breakfasts back when I was trying to gain weight, and the little voice in my head is convinced that I'll turn back into a scrawny rat if I don't eat breakfast. For the same reasons, that voice is really obsessed with working out a lot.

That voice is also convinced that studying business and technology tomes is the hidden key to success, and if I don't read enough then my career is going to fail. It's also convinced that if I don't write blog posts, my career will probably sputter too, even though I don't really write about my career on my blog. This voice has twisted logic. 

When I wrote my last blog post, I was hanging out in San Francisco with a friend who doesn't include breakfast as part of his daily routine. (quelle horreur!) He is a coffee-only before lunch kind of guy, and while I was there, I decided I would experiment with coffee-only before lunch. And you know what? I actually liked it. It saved so much time in the morning and I could get by on less caffeine since I could afford to sleep more. The world did not come crashing down around me without my standard two eggs and yogurt. 

This prompted me to ask myself an interesting question: what would I actually do with myself if I didn't try to hold to a rigorous routine day after day? What if I didn't make plans to work out? What if I didn't try to wake up earlier to squeeze more out of the day? What if I didn't try to only sleep six hours? 

Here's what happened:

* I went to the gym just twice, both days when I was in Disney World. I decided I was having way more fun [swinging heavy steel clubs around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWJMZ3sEZyQ), running outside from time to time, and playing basketball. Going to the gym in DC is just a drag for me right now. I don't like treadmills or ellipticals, I don't like waiting for benches to open up, and I don't like taking an extra hour out of my day just to get there and back. After almost ten years of being a regular gym rat, I finally took some time off. 
* I started drinking better coffee in the mornings. I upgraded my coffee game with a French press and some [Qualia Coffee](https://qualiacoffee.com/), the best brew in DC. 
* I didn't really eat breakfast. Sometimes I had toast with peanut butter.
* I slept more. I hit seven hours a night on a regular basis, and sometimes even eight. My alarm can go off at 7:30AM and I can still make it into the office by 9:00 by not working out or worrying about breakfast. 
* I learned more at work and got more done in less time, which is a direct result of not being dog tired. I suspect sleep might be one of those things where you either have to get seven-plus hours (like [Arianna Huffington](https://www.ted.com/talks/arianna_huffington_how_to_succeed_get_more_sleep?language=en)) or sub-five hours (like [Jocko Willink](https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/652810156447690754)), but there's probably not a middle ground here. I like the Huffington approach way more.
* I read four books:
	- [The Road to Character](http://amzn.to/2anxZvr) by David Brooks
	- [Seveneves](http://amzn.to/2aozc8Z) by Neal Stephenson
	- [American Gods](http://amzn.to/2aqOGKg) by Neil Gaiman
	- [Thank You, Jeeves](http://amzn.to/2aqOoTJ) by P.G. Wodehouse
* I traveled to Disney World with my college roommates. This is a super fun trip as an adult. There are certain parts of the park that you will enjoy way more once you're over 21 (you probably never knew that there's a bar in Epcot that features over a hundred tequilas and a few dozen mezcals), and there are other parts of the park that will make you feel like a kid again (hello, fireworks show at the Magic Kingdom castle). 

The most important thing that changed wasn't what I actually got accomplished. That stayed mostly constant. What changed was how I felt about it all. I was genuinely happier doing things that I liked when I let them flow into my schedule, and I was way less thrown off when I had to carve out time for an actual chore because I wasn't treating everything like a chore. It was a remarkably mentally easy way to live.

I'll be on the road a bit next month with some work-related travel and some beach-related travel. I'll be reading. I'll be learning. I'll be enjoying life a little more while I do all of it.
