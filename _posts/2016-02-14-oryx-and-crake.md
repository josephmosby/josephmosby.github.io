_Oryx and Crake_ has haunted me for a longer period of time than any book I've read in years. Naturally, I think everyone should read it.

It isn't the story that gets to you. Margaret Atwood does good work with the story-telling and writes a compelling tale with beautiful, complex characters. But it would be a standard enjoyable sciencey-fiction story in the vibe of many of the modern writers in that genre if it weren't for the *implications.* 

You know something horrible is going to happen from the beginning. When the book opens, the horribleness has already happened, and the reader is waiting for it to unfold in the ensuing flashback chapters. But as the crescendo builds to a frightening pitch, you realize that what you expected in chapter one is nowhere near as menacing and uncomfortably plausible as the apocalypse that Atwood has concocted for the reader. Eight months after the first read and I'm still thinking about it.

Go check it out. You won't be disappointed.
