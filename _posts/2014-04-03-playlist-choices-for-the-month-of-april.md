title: Playlist Choices for the Month of April
---

Every month, I start a brand new playlist that I fill with music over the course of the month. By the end of the first week, I share out what I've got so far. I've currently got Avicii's "Hey Brother" stuck in my head and my playlist starts with that in mind. You'll see some of both the EDM and old country/blues influences in this mix. 

1. Lyle Lovett - "I Will Rise Up / Ain't No More Cane"
2. Avicii - "Hey Brother"
3. Robert Randolph & the Family Band - "Going in the Right Direction"
4. The Delta Saints - "Company of Thieves"
5. Eric Clapton and B.B. King - "Riding with the King"
6. Pharrell Williams - "Happy"
7. Cage the Elephant - "Ain't No Rest for the Wicked"
8. Eisley - "Marvelous Things"
9. The 1975 - "Chocolate"
10. Bastille - "Pompeii (Audien Remix)"
11. Gorillaz - "Feel Good Inc."
12. Calvin Harris - "Summer"
13. Gareth Emery & Krewella - "Lights & Thunder"
