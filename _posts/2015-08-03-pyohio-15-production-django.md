Over the weekend, I gave a talk at PyOhio 2015 on Production Django applications. Due to the tireless efforts of the video staff, that talk is already available online less than 24 hours later.

Talk is here: [http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3712/production-django-building-a-highly-scalable-se](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3712/production-django-building-a-highly-scalable-se)

And slides are here: [http://josephmosby.com/presentations/pyohio2015](http://josephmosby.com/presentations/pyohio2015)

Special thanks to [Robert Townley](http://roberttownley.com/) who gave pre-con feedback and [Julian Gindi](http://juliangindi.com/) who gave an earlier talk that inspired some of the material.
